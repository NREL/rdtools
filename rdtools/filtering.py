def clip_filter(power, quant=0.98, low_power_cutoff=0.01):
    '''
    Filter data points likely to be affected by clipping
    with power greater than or equal to 99% of the 'quant'
    quantile and less than 'low_power_cutoff'

    Parameters
    ----------
    power : pd.Series
        AC power in Watts
    quant : float, default 0.98
        Value for upper threshold quantile
    low_power_cutoff : float, default 0.01
        Value for low-power cutoff (in Watts)

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        Boolean Series of whether the given measurement is below 99% of the
        quantile filter and above the low-power cutoff.

    Filtering based on clear sky index (csi)

    Parameters
    ----------
    measured_poa : pd.Series
        Plane of array irradiance based on measurments
    clearsky_poa : pd.Series
        Plane of array irradiance based on a clear sky model
    threshold : float, default 0.15
        threshold for filter

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        Boolean Series of whether the clear-sky index is within the threshold
        around 1.
