    "This juypter notebook is intended to the RdTools analysis workflow.  In addition, the notebook demonstrates the effects of changes in the workflow. For a consistent experience, we recommend installing the specific versions of packages used to develop this notebook. This can be achieved in your environment by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` followed by `pip install -r docs/notebook_requirements.txt` from the base directory. (RdTools must also be separately installed.) These environments and examples are tested with Python 3.7.\n",
