RdTools Overview
================

RdTools is an open-source library to support reproducible technical analysis of
time series data from photovoltaic energy systems. The library aims to provide
best practice analysis routines along with the building blocks for users to
tailor their own analyses.
Current applications include the evaluation of PV production over several years to obtain
rates of performance degradation and soiling loss. RdTools can handle
both high frequency (hourly or better) or low frequency (daily, weekly,
etc.) datasets. Best results are obtained with higher frequency data.

Full examples are worked out in the example notebooks in the
`example notebook`_.

To report issues, contribute code, or suggest improvements to this
documentation, visit the RdTools development repository on `github`_.

Workflow
--------

RdTools supports a number of workflows, but a typical analysis follows
the following:

0. Import and preliminary calculations
1. Normalize data using a performance metric
2. Filter data that creates bias
3. Aggregate data
4. Analyze aggregated data to estimate the degradation rate and/or
   soiling loss

Steps 1 and 2 may be accomplished with the clearsky workflow (see the
`example notebook`_) which can help eliminate problems from irradiance sensor
drift.

Degradation Results
-------------------

The preferred method for degradation rate estimation is the year-on-year
(YOY) approach, available in :py:func:`.degradation.degradation_year_on_year`.
The YOY calculation yields in a distribution of degradation rates, the
central tendency of which is the most representative of the true
degradation. The width of the distribution provides information about
the uncertainty in the estimate via a bootstrap calculation. The
`example notebook`_ uses the output of
:py:func:`.degradation.degradation_year_on_year` to visualize the calculation.

Two workflows are available for system performance ratio calculation,
and illustrated in an example notebook. The sensor-based approach
assumes that site irradiance and temperature sensors are calibrated and
in good repair. Since this is not always the case, a 'clear-sky'
workflow is provided that is based on modeled temperature and
irradiance. Note that site irradiance data is still required to identify
clear-sky conditions to be analyzed. In many cases, the 'clear-sky'
analysis can identify conditions of instrument errors or irradiance
sensor drift, such as in the above analysis.

The clear-sky analysis tends to provide less stable results than sensor-based
analysis when details such as filtering are changed. We generally recommend
that the clear-sky analysis be used as a check on the sensor-based results,
rather than as a stand-alone analysis.

Soiling Results
---------------

Soiling can be estimated with the stochastic rate and recovery (SRR)
method (Deceglie 2018). This method works well when soiling patterns
follow a "sawtooth" pattern, a linear decline followed by a sharp
recovery associated with natural or manual cleaning.
:py:func:`.soiling.soiling_srr` performs the calculation and returns the P50
insolation-weighted soiling ratio, confidence interval, and additional
information (``soiling_info``) which includes a summary of the soiling
intervals identified, ``soiling_info['soiling_interval_summary']``. This
summary table can, for example, be used to plot a histogram of the
identified soiling rates for the dataset.

Install RdTools using pip
-------------------------

RdTools can be installed automatically into Python from PyPI using the
command line:

::

    pip install rdtools

Alternatively it can be installed manually using the command line:

1. Download a `release`_ (Or to work with a development version, clone
   or download the rdtools repository).
2. Navigate to the repository: ``cd rdtools``
3. Install via pip: ``pip install .``

On some systems installation with ``pip`` can fail due to problems
installing requirements. If this occurs, the requirements specified in
``setup.py`` may need to be separately installed (for example by using
``conda``) before installing ``rdtools``.

For more detailed instructions, see the :ref:`developer_notes` page.

RdTools currently is tested on Python 3.6+.

Usage and examples
------------------

Full workflow examples are found in the notebooks in `example notebook`_.
The examples are designed to work with python 3.6. For a consistent
experience, we recommend installing the packages and versions documented
in ``docs/notebook_requirements.txt``. This can be achieved in your
environment by first installing RdTools as described above, then running
``pip install -r docs/notebook_requirements.txt`` from the base
directory.

The following functions are used for degradation and soiling analysis:

.. code:: python

   import rdtools

The most frequently used functions are:

.. code:: python

   normalization.normalize_with_pvwatts(energy, pvwatts_kws)
     '''
     Inputs: Pandas time series of raw energy, PVwatts dict for system analysis 
       (poa_global, power_dc_rated, temperature_cell, poa_global_ref, temperature_cell_ref, gamma_pdc)
     Outputs: Pandas time series of normalized energy and POA insolation
     '''

.. code:: python

   filtering.poa_filter(poa_global); filtering.tcell_filter(temperature_cell); 
   filtering.clip_filter(power_ac); filtering.normalized_filter(energy_normalized);
   filtering.csi_filter(poa_global_measured, poa_global_clearsky); 
     '''
     Inputs: Pandas time series of raw data to be filtered.
     Output: Boolean mask where `True` indicates acceptable data
     '''

.. code:: python

   aggregation.aggregation_insol(energy_normalized, insolation, frequency='D')
     '''
     Inputs: Normalized energy and insolation
     Output: Aggregated data, weighted by the insolation.
     '''

.. code:: python

   degradation.degradation_year_on_year(energy_normalized)
     '''
     Inputs: Aggregated, normalized, filtered time series data
     Outputs: Tuple: `yoy_rd`: Degradation rate 
       `yoy_ci`: Confidence interval `yoy_info`: associated analysis data
     '''

.. code:: python

   soiling.soiling_srr(energy_normalized_daily, insolation_daily)
     '''
     Inputs: Daily aggregated, normalized, filtered time series data for normalized performance and insolation
     Outputs: Tuple: `sr`: Insolation-weighted soiling ratio
