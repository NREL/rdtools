RdTools Overview
================

RdTools is an open-source library to support reproducible technical analysis of
time series data from photovoltaic energy systems. The library aims to provide
best practice analysis routines along with the building blocks for users to
tailor their own analyses.
Current applications include the evaluation of PV production over several years to obtain
rates of performance degradation and soiling loss. They also include the capability to
analyze systems for system- and subsystem-level availability. RdTools can handle
both high frequency (hourly or better) or low frequency (daily, weekly,
etc.) datasets. Best results are obtained with higher frequency data.

Full examples are worked out in the notebooks shown in :ref:`examples`.

To report issues, contribute code, or suggest improvements to this
documentation, visit the RdTools development repository on `github`_.

Trends
-----------------------

Both degradation and soiling analyses are based on normalized yield, similar to performance
index. Usually, this is computed at the daily level although other aggregation periods are
supported. A typical analysis of soiling and degradation contains the following:

0. Import and preliminary calculations
1. Normalize data using a performance metric
2. Filter data to reduce error
3. Aggregate data
4. Filter aggregated data to remove anomalies
5. Analyze aggregated data to estimate the degradation rate and/or
   soiling loss

It can be helpful to repeat the above steps with both ground-based measurements of weather
and satellite weather to check for drift in the ground-based measurements. This is illustrated
in the TrendAnalysis with NSRDB example.

Degradation
^^^^^^^^^^^

The preferred method for degradation rate estimation is the year-on-year
(YOY) approach (Jordan 2018), available in :py:func:`.degradation.degradation_year_on_year`.
The YOY calculation yields a distribution of degradation rates, the
central tendency of which is the most representative of the true
degradation. We note that the workflow described above and implemented in 
:py:class:`.analysis_chains.TrendAnalysis` provides an estimate of degradation rate,
not performance loss rate (PLR). PLR includes losses that are explicitly filtered
out by the primary workflow (Deceglie 2023).

The width of the distribution provides information about
the uncertainty in the estimate via a bootstrap calculation. The
:ref:`examples` use the output of
:py:func:`.degradation.degradation_year_on_year` to visualize the calculation.

Drift of weather sensors over time (particularly irradiance) can bias the results
of this workflow. The preferred way to check for this is to also run the workflow using
satellite-derived weather data such as the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and
compare results to the sensor-based analysis. If satellite data is not available,
a 'clear-sky' workflow is also available in RdTools. This workflow is based on modeled
temperature and irradiance. Note that site irradiance data is still required to identify
clear-sky conditions to be analyzed.

Satellite and clear-sky analyses tend to provide less stable results than sensor-based
analysis when details such as filtering are changed. We generally recommend
that the these be used only as a check on the sensor-based results,
rather than as stand-alone analyses.

Soiling
^^^^^^^

RdTools provides two methods for soiling analysis. The first is the
stochastic rate and recovery (SRR) method (Deceglie 2018). This method works
well when soiling patterns follow a "sawtooth" pattern, a linear decline followed
by a sharp recovery associated with natural or manual cleaning.
:py:func:`.soiling.soiling_srr` performs the calculation and returns the P50
insolation-weighted soiling ratio, confidence interval, and additional
information (``soiling_info``) which includes a summary of the soiling
intervals identified, ``soiling_info['soiling_interval_summary']``. This
summary table can, for example, be used to plot a histogram of the
identified soiling rates for the dataset.

The combined estimation of degradation and soiling (CODS) method (Skomedal 2020) is also available
in RdTools. CODS self-consistently extracts degradation, soiling, and seasonality
of the daily-aggregated normalized performance signal. It is particularly useful
when soiling trends are biasing degradation results. It's use is shown in both the TrendAnalysis
example notebook as well as the funtional API example notebook for degradation and soiling. 

TrendAnalysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An object-oriented API for complete soiling and degradation analysis including 
the normalize, filter, aggregate, analyze steps is available in
:py:class:`.analysis_chains.TrendAnalysis`. See the
`TrendAnalysis example <examples/TrendAnalysis_example_pvdaq4.html>`_ for details. 

Availability
------------

Evaluating system availability can be confounded by data loss from interrupted
datalogger or system communications. RdTools implements two methods
(Anderson & Blumenthal 2020) of distinguishing nuisance communication
interruptions from true production outages
with the :py:class:`.availability.AvailabilityAnalysis` class. In addition to
classifying data outages, it estimates lost production and calculates
energy-weighted system availability.

Install RdTools using pip
-------------------------

RdTools can be installed automatically into Python from PyPI using the
command line:

::

    pip install rdtools

Alternatively it can be installed manually using the command line:

1. Download a `release`_ (Or to work with a development version, clone
   or download the rdtools repository).
2. Navigate to the repository: ``cd rdtools``
3. Install via pip: ``pip install .``

On some systems, installation with ``pip`` can fail due to problems
installing requirements. If this occurs, the requirements specified in
``setup.py`` may need to be separately installed (for example by using
``conda``) before installing ``rdtools``.

For more detailed instructions, see the :ref:`developer_notes` page.

RdTools currently is tested on Python 3.9+.

Usage and examples
------------------

Full workflow examples are found in the notebooks in :ref:`examples`.
The examples are designed to work with python 3.12. For a consistent
experience, we recommend installing the packages and versions documented
in ``docs/notebook_requirements.txt``. This can be achieved in your
environment by first installing RdTools as described above, then running
``pip install -r docs/notebook_requirements.txt`` from the base
directory.

Documentation
-------------

Some RdTools function parameters can take one of several types.  For example,
the ``albedo`` parameter of :py:class:`TrendAnalysis` can be a static value like
``0.2`` or a time-varying ``pandas.Series``.  To indicate that a parameter can
take one of several types, we document them using the type alises listed below:

.. glossary ::

   ``numeric``
      scalar or ``pandas.Series``. Typically int or float dtype.
