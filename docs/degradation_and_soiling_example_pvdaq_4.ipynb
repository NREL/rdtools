    "This jupyter notebook is intended to the RdTools analysis workflow.  In addition, the notebook demonstrates the effects of changes in the workflow. For a consistent experience, we recommend installing the specific versions of packages used to develop this notebook. This can be achieved in your environment by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` followed by `pip install -r docs/notebook_requirements.txt` from the base directory. (RdTools must also be separately installed.) These environments and examples are tested with Python 3.7.\n",

This notebook automatically downloads and locally caches the dataset used in this example.
